## music
I've been making some random music tracks lately.
This first track is based on the [Nintendo Switch Online Playtest Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch_Online#Playtest_Program) OST; [bwav](https://gota7.github.io/Citric-Composer/specs/binaryWav.html) is an interesting format and I would like to see some of the aspects of it in other game engines.  

<audio controls>
    <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audio/ramblings-vol-1/nsopp.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    nsopp.ogg
</audio>  

This second track is just something I was doodling out, I did challenge myself to only use the [FreeBoy](https://docs.lmms.io/user-manual/en/instruments/freeboy) instrument.

    <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audio/ramblings-vol-1/gb-song40.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    gb-song40.ogg
</audio>

I also made a third track, this time it's a ringtone.

## dev
I was working on a basic shader for the ground in my upcoming overlay, it's based on the [invisible walkway in SM3DW](https://www.mariowiki.com/Invisible_walkway).

It can also show terrain while in distance (like the wall in the screenshot)
