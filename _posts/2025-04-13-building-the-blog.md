I really don't know how to write this all out off the top of my head without writing it in a fake FAQ format, afterall I am writing this article as I am actively coding the blog. **the faq section was written at 2025-04-13 at 2:14AM EDT**

## Why did you want a blog?
it's pretty simple. I wanted to make one for a good while and I never really had an excuse to make it until the recent release of [Hacker News](https://news.colonq.computer).

## How long did you want a blog?
A good while. Probably about around the time I was developing [game name](https://crazykitty357.itch.io/game-name) (a little under a year ago)

## Why isn't the blog in godot?
It wouldn'tve been compatible with a lot of the blogging tech that's already avalible, yeah sure I could made a markdown to bbcode converter but running the blog on mobile would've been next to impossible and good luck trying to have people download a client for a simple blog to help improve it's performance. also the blog wouldn't be compatible with rss readers.

## The end of the fake FAQ
I really don't know how long this blog will last. Like all projects I get really motivated at it when I first start it then as I work on it I get more and more demotivated and I no longer want to work on the project. This is probably because I constantly work on the project for 1-2 weeks straight. I know the blog will be frequently updating as I start building it out then I will probably write new posts as I do more things.
